&emsp;&emsp;Communicating Markup Language(CML) is a set of markup conventions aimed at improving efficiency in daily **natural language** conversation. It is designed under the principle of "Simple, portable and helpful". It's expected to be used naturally and easily under various circumstances such as **WeChat**, **Face-to-face Talking** and **Full-text Correspondences**. With the upcoming **Ideology Modeling System(IMS)** providing a neat interface, your chat records embedded with CML can be smoothly transformed and emplaced in your own IMS instance.
